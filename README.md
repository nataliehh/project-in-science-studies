This Github repository has been created for my internship project regarding the detection of bodies of water, in particular lakes, around Denmark.  

## Setup
Clone the repository. The following folders should be added:
- [SoftPool](https://github.com/alexandrosstergiou/SoftPool/tree/master)
- `data_prepped`, which is created using the [S1S2 water repository](https://github.com/MWieland/s1s2_water/tree/main)

Ensure that the correct packages are installed, as shown in `requirements.txt`.
